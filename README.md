# Which college majors will pay the bills?

Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help you pay the bills? Think you're set with an Engineering degree? Choosing a college major is a complex decision evaluating personal interest, difficulty, and career prospects. Your first paycheck right out of college might say a lot about your salary potential by mid-career. Whether you're in school or navigating the postgrad world, join me as we explore the short and long term financial implications of this major decision.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we'll be using data collected from a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc., made available here by the Wall Street Journal for their article Ivy League's Big Edge: Starting Pay. After doing some data clean up, we'll compare the recommendations from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means clustering analysis, and visualize the results.
